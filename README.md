# tech-blog

For this, I was trying to make a plog post application that takes in a user's information when they sign up, which would then allow them to create and add blog posts. This is done possible when dealing with Sequlize, bcyrpt, and MVC. Unforuantely this time I waited to long to do the assignment and was not able to debug what I have.
